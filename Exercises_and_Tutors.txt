# specify solver setup
# one line consists of
#   (1) the keyword
#       "Timeout" or "Threads" or "NumExercises" or
#       to set a solving timeout or the number of threads
#   (2) the value
# Timeout: timeout in seconds for the solver
# Threads: number of threads to use for solving
# Exercises: choose the best n exercises out of the ones that are specified below
#   -> e.g., specify 20 exercises and set "Exercises 13" to choose the best 13 exercises out of the 20 specified ones
Timeout 60
Threads 1
Exercises 13

# specify exercises
# one line consists of

#   (2) the day (e.g., "Monday")
#   (3) and the start time (e.g., 10 for "10:00 am")
#   (4) the max. number of tutors that can be assigned to this exercise
#       (e.g., when 2 exercises can be held simultaneously)

# specify tutors
# one line consists of
#   (1) the keyword "Tutor",
#   (2) the tutor's name,
#   (3) the maximum number of groups he/she wants to do
#   (4) and a weighting factor for that tutor (e.g. 3)
# (default for all tutors is 1.0 which weighs all tutors equally)
# this might be useful when PhD candidates also do exercises
# so we can force the solver to try to respect their preferences a bit more than those of HiWis
